## My process

I started from the HTML structure. Later the CSS to make it equal to the design project. I used Custom variables for the colors and the box shadow.
I used the mobile first pattern, with the measures passed in the requirements for the project. With that and the font size and weight, i guess the width of the card.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow  
  

### What I learned

I learned how to make a challenge from the site and how to submit it.
